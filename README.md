## Hi, I'm Ana Camila âœ¨

### About me
<p>I'm Brazilian currently living in SÃ£o Paulo. Nowadays I'm working at Avanade Brazil as a Software Engineer with focus on front end development. I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at Faculdade de CiÃªncias Aplicadas e Sociais de Petrolina located in Brazil. I have work experience in HTML 5, CSS 3 (Sass), JavaScript (TS), Angular 8, Git, Jenkins, Bootstrap and Wordpress. I also have knowledge in back end development with Java and Springboot. Even though I have a strong knowledge in front-end development I don't narrow myself to just this, I'm always learning how to delivery a software end-to-end taking DevOps courses and cloud computing with Azure and AWS. I'm fluent in English and basic in Spanish and German. </p>
